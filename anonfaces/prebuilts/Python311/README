ALL CUDA DLIBS BUILT WITH CUDA 12.6 AND CUDNN 9.4
THEY LOOK FOR LIB FILES IN SPECIFIC DIRECTORIES
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE CHANGED FROM V9.4 TO ANY 9.X
AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE CHANGED FROM V12.6 TO ANY 12.X


IN THE DIRECTORY HERE
%localappdata%\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\dlib


EDIT THE __init__.py TO THE NEW/EXACT LOCATIONS THAT MATCHES YOUR VERSION WITHIN 12.X AND 9.X


if 'ON' == 'ON':
    add_lib_to_dll_path('C:/Program Files/NVIDIA/CUDNN/v9.4/lib/cudnn.lib')
    add_lib_to_dll_path('C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v12.6/lib/x64/cudart.lib')
	
	

THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH 11.X AS FAR AS I KNOW. PREBUILTS FOR THOSE WILL COME SOON
